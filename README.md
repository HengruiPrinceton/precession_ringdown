# precession_ringdown

This repository contains the QNM fitting data that was extracted while producing the paper []. It is stored in `QNM_results.json` and can be used to produce the Figures in the paper by running `python plot_results.py`. We also include a script showing how this QNM fitting data was created, for an example simulation with index `192`; it is called `analysis_example.py` and can reproduce the `QNM_results_example.json` file by running `python analysis_example.py`.

Necessary python module for using this repository (besides the common ones) are: `sxs`, `scri`, `spherical_functions` and `quaternion`.
